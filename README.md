# A subtle introduction to R
#### _These contents are part of the [RECSM Summer School](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey/summer-school-2019)_

### Course description
R is a free programming language designed to apply statistical analysis and produce data visualization. Among its endless capabilities, R is famous among statistical software for its flexibility in creating functions, packages, data visualization, for being open source and for offering a wide range of statistical tools. The aim of this seminar is to introduce you to the R language and give you hands-on experience on how to use it.

R has a steep learning curve. This means that it takes a lot of work and persistence to achieve fluency. Just as when you learn a new language, the process requires practice, repetition and familiarity. It is impossible to learn the necessary R skills that will help you achieve your day-to-data tasks in a single class. For that reason, this seminar will concentrate on two core objectives: understanding the building blocks of R and learn to understand R code. The former will allow you to start writing code right away, and in addition, it will give you the basic fundamentals to understand the latter.

Because many of the seminars at the RECSM summer school will be conducted in R, we want to make you sure you understand the most in the least time possible. For that reason, we’ll spend a great deal of time reading and adapting R code. We’ll do that by presenting you with actual R code from previous RECSM seminars, running through each step and adapting it to our own needs.
